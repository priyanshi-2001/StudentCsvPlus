Created a Simple Django Project where user will download a sample csv file. It will have field like schoolName,name,age,email,father_name,mother_name,standard,etc.
User can add many rows in that csv sheet and that data will get added to the dashboard and it will be shown in frontend.
The backend api is using pagination through slicing in python and user can filter records on basis of name,email,schoolName,etc.
